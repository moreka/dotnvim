# My Neovim Configuration

I got inspired by [LazyVim](https://github.com/folke/LazyVim) and the way it
handles lazy loading. However, I try to keep things as minimal as possible. I do
not want to have too many plugins.

Needs Neovim nightly features to run properly.

## Features

- **LaTeX** using [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex). I used Karl's
[dotfiles](https://github.com/lervag/dotnvim) to set up vimtex and make it
closer to what I need.
- TBD.
